We need to create a backend for the service which will post information about 
Android notifications to the server.

The backend is very lightweight, QPS will be minimal. Please keep the structure 
simple and easy to understand, do not over engineer, do not create any unnecessary  abstractions.

For the database, use something very simple and lightweight. It can be document
based or key-value based, or SQL based, but it should be lightweigth and portable.

Minimize use of JavaScript. 

The format of notification will be as follows:

```json
{
    "title": "Notification Title",
    "message": "Notification Message",
    "timestamp": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "package_name": "com.example.app"
    "from": "Other User Name" // optional, can be user or chat group name
    "device_id": "abc1234" // arbitrary string
}
```

The server will store all notifications in the database, propose which 
database to use.

The server will also provide a web interface for the user to view notifications.
The UI of the web interface should include:

1. Choosing which device to show notifications for
2. List of notifications
3. Option to navigate notifications for a specific day, using date picker
4. Option to show notification for a range of days
5. Option to quickly search for a notification by title, message or from field

The UI should be responsive and adaptive, and should work on desktop, tablet and mobile.

Propose technologies to use for the backend and the web interface.

Before generating anything, suggest me a plan of action, what to do first, what to do next 
and wait for my approval before continuing.
